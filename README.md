# LED-Micro-Drone-Gate-for-Racing
This project aims to build a micro-drone gate with two ultrasonic sensors connected to an LCD to create a stopwatch that displays how fast a drone's race lap is. When the stopwatch is paused or senses that the lap has finished, the LEDs will turn red. While in the lap, the LEDs will have a slow rainbow gradient.

I used Fusion360 to create the case for the circuit and power supplies for the Arduino and LED strip. I made the case into two pieces to allow for easy access to the circuit if any problems occur. Both pieces are available to download.

I soldered extra male-to-male jumper wires to the button to reach the top of the 3D box and connected female-to-male jumper wires to the LCD instead of having it in the breadboard.
