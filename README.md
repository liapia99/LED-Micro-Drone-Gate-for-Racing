# LED-Micro-Drone-Gate-for-Racing
This project aims to build a micro-drone gate with two ultrasonic sensors connected to an LCD to create a stopwatch that displays how fast a drone's race lap is. When the stopwatch is paused or senses that the lap has finished, the LEDs will turn red. While in the lap, the LEDs will have a slow rainbow gradient.
